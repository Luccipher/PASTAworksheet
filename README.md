I. Define business
and security
objectives: Make 2-3 notes of specific business requirements that will be
analyzed. 1. The system should allow users to create member profiles either internally or by connecting external accounts. 2. The application must be capable of handling and processing financial transactions effectively and securely

II. Define the
technical scope: The application utilizes the following technologies:

Application programming interface (API)
Public key infrastructure (PKI)
Advanced encryption system (AES)
SHA-256
SQL
APIs play a crucial role in facilitating data exchange between customers, partners, and employees, making them a top priority. As they connect different users and systems, APIs handle sensitive data. However, it is essential to consider specific API details before prioritizing one technology over another. This is because APIs can be more susceptible to security vulnerabilities due to their larger attack surface.

IV. Threat analysis: 1.Injection: This refers to the vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious code or commands into an application's input fields, such as forms or query parameters. By exploiting this weakness, the attacker can manipulate the application's behavior, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even take control of the entire system. 2. Session hijacking: This threat involves unauthorized individuals intercepting and taking control of a user's session or session identifier. By exploiting security vulnerabilities, such as weak session management or insecure communication channels, attackers can impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform malicious activities within the application.

VI. Risk analysis and
impact: SHA-256, incident response procedures, password policy,
principle of least privilege
